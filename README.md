## Global Variables <a name='global-variables'></a>

- `g_volatilityThreshold`: This variable represents the volatility threshold for activating trading strategies. It is currently set to 5.
- `g_newsReleaseTime`: This variable represents the time in seconds before news events to activate trading strategies. It is currently set to 30.

## Expert Initialization <a name='expert-initialization'></a>

The `OnInit()` function is the expert initialization function. It is called once during the expert advisor startup. In this function, the algorithm is initialized by calling the `InitializeAlgorithm()` function. The initialization result is returned as `INIT_SUCCEEDED`.

## Expert Deinitialization <a name='expert-deinitialization'></a>

The `OnDeinit()` function is the expert deinitialization function. It is called when the expert advisor is being stopped or removed from the chart. In this function, the algorithm is deinitialized by calling the `DeinitializeAlgorithm()` function.

## Expert Tick <a name='expert-tick'></a>

The `OnTick()` function is the expert tick function. It is called on every tick of the market. In this function, the following steps are performed:

1. Perform rapid market analysis by calling the `PerformMarketAnalysis()` function.
2. Check for market volatility by calling the `CheckVolatility()` function.
3. Check for news events by calling the `CheckNewsEvents()` function.
4. Execute trading strategies by calling the `ExecuteTradingStrategies()` function.

## Market Analysis <a name='market-analysis'></a>

The `PerformMarketAnalysis()` function is responsible for implementing market analysis logic. Please note that the specific market analysis logic is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.

## Volatility Check <a name='volatility-check'></a>

The `CheckVolatility()` function is responsible for implementing volatility check logic. Please note that the specific volatility check logic is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.

## News Event Check <a name='news-event-check'></a>

The `CheckNewsEvents()` function is responsible for implementing news event check logic. Please note that the specific news event check logic is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.

## Execute Trading Strategies <a name='execute-trading-strategies'></a>

The `ExecuteTradingStrategies()` function is responsible for executing trading strategies. Please note that the specific trading strategy execution logic is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.

## Algorithm Initialization <a name='algorithm-initialization'></a>

The `InitializeAlgorithm()` function is responsible for initializing the algorithm. Please note that the specific initialization logic is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.

## Algorithm Deinitialization <a name='algorithm-deinitialization'></a>

The `DeinitializeAlgorithm()` function is responsible for deinitializing the algorithm. Please note that the specific deinitialization logic is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.
